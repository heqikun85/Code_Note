## Experience
**TikTok Video Winner Game**
- The goal of this project is to create a web page that showcases the best TikTok videos based on a PageRank algorithm. 
- The web page will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite3. 
- The key features include fetching data asynchronously from the server, implementing AJAX requests for seamless interaction, and performing database operations to store and retrieve video information.
<br/>
***Technologies Used:***   
- HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the web page.  
- JavaScript: Used for client-side interactions and AJAX requests.  
- Node.js: Used as the server-side runtime environment.  
- Express.js: Used as the web application framework for Node.js.  
- SQLite3: Used as the database management system for storing video data.  
- PageRank Algorithm: Implemented to rank and select the hottest videos for display.

**California Reservoir Water Levels Web Page**
- The objective of this project is to create a web page that displays water level data for California reservoirs.   
- The data is fetched from the California Data Exchange Center (CDEC), a government data service, using their public API. The web page is built using React.js for the front end, and a Node.js/Express.js server for handling AJAX requests to fetch data from the CDEC API.   
- The fetched data is then displayed as a chart on the web page using a charting library.
<br/>
***Technologies Used:***   
- React.js: Used for building the user interface and handling client-side rendering.
- Node.js: Used for server-side development.  
- Express.js: Used as the web application framework for Node.js to handle server requests.  
- Public Data API (CDEC): Used to fetch reservoir water level data.  
- Charting Library: Utilized to visualize the fetched data as a chart on the web page.

**UC Davis Wiki Platform**  
- The project aimed to develop a comprehensive wiki platform for UC Davis students to access and contribute to campus-related information.   
- As a backend developer, my role primarily involved designing and implementing backend functionalities to manage user data and handle user contributions    
***Technologies Used:***   
- Java: Used as the primary programming language for backend development.
- Spring Boot: Employed as the framework for building robust and scalable backend applications.
- Spring Data JPA: Used for data access and persistence.
- MySQL: Chosen as the database management system to store user data and wiki entries.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Utilized for user authentication and authorization.
- Git: Utilized for version control and collaboration among team members.

**Elevator Simulation System with Visual Desktop Interface**

- The goal of this project was to design and implement a system that simulates real elevator operation.   
- The system needed to accurately replicate various functions of an elevator, including pressing elevator buttons, selecting passenger floors, managing the number of passengers, and simulating elevator movement in both upward and downward directions.   
- Additionally, the system was required to simulate elevator load and capacity constraints. To provide a user-friendly interface for interaction, the system's visual desktop operation interface was developed using Visual Studio MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class).   
***Technologies Used:***  
- C++: Used as the primary programming language for implementing the elevator simulation system.  
- Visual Studio MFC: Employed to develop the visual desktop interface for the system.  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilized for designing and implementing modular and maintainable code.
- Multithreading: Implemented to simulate concurrent elevator operations and passenger interactions.
- Data Structures: Used to model elevator buttons, passenger floors, and elevator states effectively.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) Design: Employed to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for elevator control and monitoring.
