### First sets
Regular example:
< Program > ::= < Block >
< Block > ::= {< Stmt >}
< Stmt > ::= < Assign > | < While >
< Assign > ::= id ':=' < Exp >
< Exp > ::= id | num
< While > ::= while < Exp > do < Block > end

First(While) = {While}
First(Exp) = {id, num}
First(Assign) = {id}
First(Stmt) = First(Assign) ∪ First(While) = {id, While}
First(Block) = {ε}∪First(Stmt) = {ε, id, While}
First(Program) = {ε, id, While}

Assume the following:
•sym: a global variable to store a token
•next(): a routine that sets sym to the next token in the input
•f_X: denotes the set First(X) where X is a non-terminal (left hand side)
•error(): an error handling routine (like what happens when input has while followed by do but no id or num in-between)
